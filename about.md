Welcome to the second year of the OlympCICS competition at the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences!

OlympCICS is a four-day student-run extravaganza tailor-made for you (a Manning CICS grad student)! It's all about fun, competitions, and free food. 

Grad students "take over" the CS and LGRC buildings for a week to take a break, have some fun, and recharge.  The event is graciously funded and supported by the department.

<!-- OlympCICS is fully student-run and friendly competition over winter break for Manning CICS grad students (MS, MS/PhD, PhD).   -->

<!-- It's graciously funded by our department so supplies and  -->
