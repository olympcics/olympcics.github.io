title: What is this?
---

This is the website for the second year of the OlympCICS competition at the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences.

OlympCICS is a student-run celebration and friendly competition over winter break for Manning CICS grad students (MS, MS/PhD, PhD).  Grad students "take over" the CS and LGRC buildings during the week 

It's graciously funded by the department so we can get supplies and food for participants!
